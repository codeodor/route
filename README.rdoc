Route is an experiment to see what it would look like if Rails controllers specified how to reach themselves, rather than having an omniscient routes.rb file.

It contains a simple Rails project which illustrates a proof of concept in https://github.com/codeodor/route/blob/master/app/controllers/courses_controller.rb. 

The code behind the proof of concept is in a gem which you'll find here: https://github.com/codeodor/route/tree/master/vendor/gems/route

It hooks into Rails with the railtie: https://github.com/codeodor/route/blob/master/vendor/gems/route/lib/route/railtie.rb and it does the work of sending the calls to specify routes in https://github.com/codeodor/route/blob/master/vendor/gems/route/lib/route/route.rb
